# Learn how to transfer AVAX tokens from the C-chain of an AVAX wallet to an ETH wallet.

In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to programmatically transfer native AVAX tokens from the C-chain to an ETH wallet.

We will need to import the appropriate libraries (web3 and ethers). So, let's begin by installing them first.
Both web3.js and ethers.js are Ethereum Javascript APIs desinged to help interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The C-chain of Avalanche shares the same libraries. This allows Ethereum developers to migrate over to Avalanche with minimal effort.

We will install the ethers.js library by entering the following line into the terminal
```text
npm install ethers
```

and install the web3.js library by entering the following line into the terminal.
```text
npm install web3
```


After installing the libraries, we need to import them in order to use the libraries to interact with the Avalanche C-chain. 

```text
const Web3 = require("web3")
const { ethers } = require('ethers')
```

The mnemonic key from your AVAX wallet needs to go between the quotation marks below. This is later used to extract the C chain wallet address.

```text
let mnemonic = "";
```

The code below is pointing to the Fuji network. Alternatively, we can point it to the Datahub AVAX node. 

```text
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc"))   
```

The private key is needed to execute a transfer later on. With the mnemonic phrase provided earlier, we can obtain the private key to your AVAX wallet in the ETH address format.

```text
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic);
AVAX_privatekey = wallet.privateKey;             
```

The web3 package is designed to interact with an Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts. The web3 module is capable of acting upon the AVAX implementation of the EVM. So, when interacting with the C-chain, the web3 module is used. Here, web3.eth.getBalance fetches the AVAX balance. Additionally, when printing the balance of the C-chain into the terminal, you want to  

```text
async function main(){
    web3.eth.getBalance(wallet.address, function(err, result) {    
        if (err) {
          console.log(err)
        } else {
          console.log(web3.utils.fromWei(result, "ether") + " AVAX")
        }
      })
```

result in `web3.utils.fromWei` above is the balance of the account in the units of wei (The minimum unit of Ether is called wei and 1 Ether is 10^18 wei). `fromWei` is a method in web3.utils, converting a number from one unit to another. So,`web3.utils.fromWei(result, "ether")` above converts the balance from wei to ether. Since we are viewing the AVAX token balance, we will print AVAX at the end. 

The block below is to view the # of transactions associated with the wallet address(not necessary for the purpose of AVAX transfer from C chain to an ETH address) but could be useful when you later want to transfer an ERC20 token 

```text
    web3.eth.getTransactionCount(wallet.address)       
    .then(console.log);                                               
    const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(           
        {
           gas: 21000,
```

Copy and paste your ETH destination address beween the quotation marks below

```text
           to:"",
```

Below, we need to input how many tokens are to be transferred out of your AVAX wallet off the C-chain. Currently the amount is arbitrarily set to 0.15 AVAX tokens as an example (0.15 tokens in the line below). 

```text
           value: web3.utils.toWei('0.15', 'ether'),     
        },
        AVAX_privatekey                                 
     );
     const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
        createTransaction.rawTransaction
     );
     console.log(
        `Transaction successful with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}`
     );
  };
main().catch((err) => {
    console.log("We have encountered an error!")
    console.error(err)
})
```

## Wrapping Up

Thatâ€™s it! This tutorial has taught you how to transfer AVAX native tokens from the C-chain to an ETH wallet. Also, this has shown how Avalanche blockchain C-chain is compatible with the usual web3 library. This is a powerful aspect of the Avalanche blockchain, as it allows Ethereum devlopers to easily port their work over to the Avalanche side.

Try transfering your Fuji AVAX tokens by running this script and see if it worked.
